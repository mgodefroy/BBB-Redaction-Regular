# redaction


110 inclusives glyphs has been added to this font by Marie Godefroy for the first issue of Curseurs, thanks to the guide of Bye Bye Binary on gitlab.com/bye-bye-binary and https://typotheque.genderfluid.space/quni.html The inclusives glyphs can be found only on the version of "Redaction Regular". However, there are others styles like Italic and Bold in each version and the versions 10,20,35,50,70 and 100, also without inclusives glyphs.
